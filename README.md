eratosthenes
============

This is a test GitHub repo. The only item contained herein is a solution in Java to Project Euler Problem 50. The solution uses a Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a list of candidate primes. The solution is computed quickly enough; other than Eratosthenes, no optimizations to memory or computational time will be evident.

```
The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?
